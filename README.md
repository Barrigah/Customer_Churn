In this comprehensive project, we adopt an all-inclusive approach to predict customer churn by identifying specific criteria that indicate the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services.
## Introduction
Customer churn, also referred to as customer attrition or customer defection, is a term used to describe the situation when customers terminate their association with a business or cease utilizing its products or services. It reflects the rate at which customers disengage or end their involvement with a company within a specific timeframe. The primary objective of this project was to predict potential churn customers using historical data provided by our client. It involved a classification problem that utilized a supervised machine learning approach. To begin the analysis, I formulated queries to join tables and extract the necessary data from the database. Through data exploration and transformation, and employing statistical techniques such as Variance Inflation Factor, Recursive Feature Elimination, and assessment of multicollinearity, I reduced the initial set of 158 derived features to the most crucial eight features. These selected features were utilized as the final set for prediction. The predictive model successfully identified over 4,000 potential churners, which has the potential to generate an additional annual revenue of over $2,000,000 for the business.
